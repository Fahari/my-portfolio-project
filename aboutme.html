      <p>Hi there, I am a self proclaimed artist with a passion for web design and programming. I'm currently studying web development at <span class="green">Moringa School</span>, a Silicon Savanna Tech hub, in Kenya Nairobi.</p>

    <div class="block">
      <p>I decided to take programming and advance my tech <em>skills</em> after having been to University and studied <strong>Computer Science</strong>. However, I did not feel like the knowledge acquired there could equip me with the necessary programming <em>skills</em> required in the Tech Industry. And so, I took up the challange and decided to enroll in a bootcamp and have never looked back ever since. </p>
