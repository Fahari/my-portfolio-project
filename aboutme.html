      <p>Hi there, I am a self proclaimed artist with a passion for web design and programming. I'm currently studying web development at Moringa School, a Silicon Savanna Tech hub, in Kenya Nairobi.</p>

    <div class="block">
      <p>I decided to take programming and advance my tech skills after having been to University and studied Computer Science. However, I did not feel like the knowledge acquired there could equip me with the necessary programming skills required in the Tech Industry. And so, I took up the challange and decided to enroll in a bootcamp and have never looked back ever since. </p>

    <div class="block">
      <p>I had done some simple projects prior to joining Moringa written in languages like</p>
      <ol>
        <li><a href="#">C</a></li>
        <li>C++</li>
        <li>Java</li>
      </ol>
      <p>I currently have different hobbies revolving around</p>
      <ul>
        <li>programming</li>
        <li>Fine art</li>
