    <h3>welcome to my site!</h3>
    <p>My first home on the internet. It's a small and simple home I know, but I am a proud owner.</p>
    <p>As you can see, the interior of the home is made of brighter shades of black with  light furbishes of white here and there.
    I was able to accomplish this look without a loan from bright and outspoken colors and the fact that I fell inlove with fifty shades of grey.</p>
    <p>I am on a mission though, being a self proclaimed interior designer. I want to redesign my home in the near future, give it a more elegant and precise look. Build it bigger and in depth so that it can accomodate more visitors like you. Most likely have a jacuzzi and a sauna for those who will be arriving via high bandwidth speeds.</p>
    <p>But for now, it remains as is, subtle and soft for the hawk eyed.
    <p>For the Aqua choice of color for my door to my sleeping quarters, I just like surprising myself. You probably agree the life in the master quarters should be colourful right?. so do I.</p>
    <p>Well, come on in. Lets see what lies behind that "Aqua" door.</p>
